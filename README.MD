## Description
This repository contains my solutions to various Codewars challenges. The challenges are organized based on their kyu ratings. The main goal of this repository is to improve my problem-solving skills, critical thinking skills, and proficiency in JavaScript.

In this repository, you will find a collection of Codewars challenges that I have solved. Codewars is a platform that provides coding challenges of varying difficulty levels, known as kyu ratings. By working on these challenges, I aim to enhance my programming abilities and deepen my understanding of JavaScript.

## Reason for Doing Codewars Challenges

There are several reasons why I have chosen to engage in Codewars challenges:

1. **Improving Problem-Solving Skills**: Codewars challenges are designed to test problem-solving abilities. By tackling these challenges, I can enhance my logical thinking and develop effective strategies to solve complex problems.

2. **Enhancing Critical Thinking Skills**: Codewars challenges often require analyzing the problem, identifying patterns, and devising efficient solutions. Engaging in these challenges helps sharpen my critical thinking skills and fosters creativity in finding innovative approaches.

3. **Becoming Proficient in JavaScript**: Codewars challenges provide an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of JavaScript. By solving diverse problems, I can explore different aspects of the language and gain hands-on experience with various JavaScript concepts, functions, and algorithms.

## Folder Structure

The challenges in this repository are organized based on their kyu ratings. Here is an overview of the folder structure:
